# Dotfiles

These are all the configuration I have setup or modified from other config files focusing on producivity, performance and ease-of-use. The configuration should be modified to use them in your system.
&nbsp;

### Configurations for these tools:
* [Neovim](https://neovim.io/): As my Editor.
* [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/installation.html): As my Terminal Emulator.
&nbsp;

### Neovim (Dependencies):
* [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim): Way better than fuzzy finder.
* [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim): My Package manager.
* [Lsp-zero](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim): For Lsp.
* [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim): Portable package manager mainly for Lsp servers.
* [Treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter): Syntax highlighting for most of the languages out there.
* [Harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon): Quick navigation between buffers.
* [Undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree): For looking back into the changes (I rarely use this but is very interesting).
* [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive): Git tool.
* Color_scheme: {'[gruvbox](https://github.com/ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim)', '[melange](https://github.com/savq/melange-nvim)', '[tokyonight](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim)', '[rose-pine](https://github.com/rose-pine/neovim)', '[fahrenheit](https://github.com/fcpg/vim-fahrenheit)'} (I prefer fahrenheit)
* [Lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim): Cool Status line.
* [Comment](https://github.com/numToStr/Comment.nvim): Provides VSCode shortcuts for commenting.

### Wezterm (Dependencies):
* [Nerdfont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/): Cool fonts specially for coders.(I rarely use 3rd party fonts but there are some cool collections with them check em out!)
&nbsp;

### How to use this:
* Dump the file into `~/.config` and see the magic. (If you use NVIM)
* You can change my folder or file names and call it anything you like.
* Place the .vimrc file in the root directory '~/' and see the magic. (If you use VIM)
* Restart the Terminal Emulator. (or source the config files of NVIM/VIM)
